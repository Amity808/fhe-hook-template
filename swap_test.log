=== FHE Hook Frontend Integration Example ===

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Ensure the pool exists, is initialized, AND has liquidity!
   If you get 'require(false)' errors during swap, it's likely missing liquidity.

   Quick fix - Add liquidity:
   forge script script/02_AddLiquidity.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast

   Or create pool + liquidity together:
   forge script script/01_CreatePoolAndMintLiquidity.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast
